# Multiclass_Fish_Image_Classification

## üìò Project Overview

This project focuses on building and deploying a Multiclass Fish Image Classification system using deep learning.
The goal is to classify fish images into multiple categories using both a custom CNN model and transfer learning with pre-trained models.

The project also demonstrates how to:

Preprocess and augment image data.

Train, evaluate, and compare multiple deep learning models.

Deploy a Streamlit web app that predicts the fish category from user-uploaded images.

## üåç Domain

Image Classification

## üß† Skills Gained

Deep Learning, Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, Data Preprocessing, Transfer Learning, Model Evaluation, Visualization, and Model Deployment

## üß© Approach
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

Load dataset using TensorFlow‚Äôs ImageDataGenerator.

Rescale images to [0,1].

Apply augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, shifting).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

Train a custom CNN from scratch.

Fine-tune five pre-trained models:

VGG16

ResNet50

MobileNet

InceptionV3

EfficientNetB0

Save the best-performing model (.h5 or .pkl).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

Compute metrics:
